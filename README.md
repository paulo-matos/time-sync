Development
The timezone list is located in timezones.js.

Add new timezones by updating the TIMEZONE_DATA array with:

zone: valid IANA timezone string.

display: user-friendly display name.

aliases: searchable keywords (city names, country, abbreviation, etc.).

Main app logic is in popup.html and popup.js.

Technologies
JavaScript (ES6+)

Luxon for date/time management

Chrome Extensions API

Notes
Only valid IANA timezone names are supported for Luxon compatibility.

Day/Night calculation is approximate based on representative city coordinates.

No external API is required for search; all data is local for speed and reliability.
